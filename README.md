# 7-Zip-ZSTD-Portable
7-Zip with additional algorithms, made portable. Windows x64 Sources: https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd + https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable &amp; some needed modifications.


This works as described, but if you plan to install a file archiver I reccomend:

NanaZip now: https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip It's another 7zip fork, with zstandard and native windows 11 context menu integration.

Peazip is a completely diferent FOSS archiver, multiplatofrm, with even more formats supported. But sometimes I have issues, with it not inputing/outputing consistently. It's best on Linux. https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/releases/
