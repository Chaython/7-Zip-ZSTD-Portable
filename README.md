# 7-Zip-ZSTD-Portable
7-Zip with additional algorithms, made portable. Windows x64 Sources: https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd + https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable &amp; some needed modifications.


This works as described, but I reccomend Peazip now, as .7z can now be compressed as zstd using it, where before .zstd/tar before was the only solution. https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/releases/
