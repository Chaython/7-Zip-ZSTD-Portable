# 7-Zip-ZSTD-Portable
7-Zip with additional algorithms, made portable. Windows x64 Sources: https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd + https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable &amp; some needed modifications.


This works as described, but I reccomend NanaZip now: https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip It's another 7zip zstandard fork.

Alternatively Peazip is a completely diferent FOSS archiver, with even more formats supported. But sometimes I have issues, with it not inputing/outputing consistently. https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/releases/
